them up to date on the latest research and news in the field, and raise awareness of cyber security issues in Ireland to encourage more people to become interested in this critical topic.

## Agile Planning

This project was devised using agile practices, with small features delivered in incremental sprints.

There were four sprints in total, that were distributed out at two weeks.

All issues were assigned to epics and prioritized utilizing the labels must, should, could, and nice to have.

They were divided into sprints based on six milestones. "Must have" stories were finished first, followed by "should have" stories, and ultimately "could have" and "nice to have" stories.

This has been done to ensure that all foundational requirements were completed initially, providing the application a complete feel, with must-have features added.

## Epics/Milestones

This project has 6 main Epics/Milestones:

 1. Basic Setup

    > The basic setup milestone contains all of the stories needed for the blog's initial setup.
    The blog wouldn't be feasible without the basic setup, so it was the initial epic to
    be produced since all other functionalities are dependent on the successful completion
    of the basic setup.

 2. Stand Alone Pages Setup

    > The stand alone pages milestone is for comparatively tiny pages with insufficient stories
    to justify a full milestone. Rather than generating milestones for minimal features like
    error pages, these minimal features were categorized under this milestone.

 3. Authentication Setup

    >The authentication milestone includes all stories concerning registration, login, and
    authentication. This milestone is critical and important because otherwise, the blog's
    administrators would be unable to manage posts or comments securely without normal users
    having the ability to see and execute administrator commands.

 4. Admin Setup

    >The milestone admin setup includes all stories concerning creating, viewing, updating, and
    deleting posts, in addition to managing comments, users, and categories. This makes it
    simple for administrators to view posts, manage posts, manage comments on these posts,
    and manage administrator users and categories.

 5. User Views

    > The milestone users views feature allows a blog user to leave a comment on a post,
    filter categories, and bookmark a post. This milestone is critical and essential for
    an user in order to create a comment, filter, and categorize posts.

 6. Documentation

    > This milestone includes all document-related stories and tasks required to
    document the software development process for the application. It aspires to
    provide high-quality documentation that aids in the understanding of all stages of
    development in addition to the information required for running, deploying, 
    and operating the application.
