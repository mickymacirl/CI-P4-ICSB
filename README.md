# Irish Cyber Security Blog

Irish Cyber Security Blog is a **blog** to *store information* about **irish cyber security topics**, *share thoughts and insights with others in the community and stay up to date with the latest threats and solutions*.
It allows users to **read**, **comment on** and **bookmark** posts posted by the administrators of the blog.

## User Experience Design (UX)

## The Strategy Plane

## Site Goals

 The goal of this Irish cyber security blog is to provide readers in Ireland with accurate and up-to-date information about cyber security, educate the Irish public on how to stay safe online and protect themselves from cyber threats, assist Irish businesses and organizations in improving their cyber security practices and defending themselves against cyber-attacks, act as a resource for Irish cyber security professionals by bringing them up to date on the latest research and news in the field, and raise awareness of cyber security issues in Ireland to encourage more people to become interested in this critical topic.

## Agile Planning

The project was developed using agile practices, with small features delivered in incremental sprints over a two-week period. Issues were organized into milestones and prioritized using labels such as "must have," "should have," "could have," and "nice to have." These milestones were divided into sprints based on six milestones, with "must have" stories being completed first, followed by "should have" stories, and finally "could have" and "nice to have" stories. This prioritization ensured that all essential requirements were completed first, providing a solid foundation for the application and allowing for the addition of must-have features.

## Milestones

This project has 6 main Milestones:

 1. Basic Setup

    > The basic setup milestone contains all of the stories needed for the blog's initial setup.
    The blog wouldn't be feasible without the basic setup, so it was the initial milestone to
    be produced since all other functionalities are dependent on the successful completion
    of the basic setup.

 2. Stand Alone Pages Setup

    > The standalone pages milestone is for comparatively tiny pages with insufficient stories
    to justify a full milestone. Rather than generating milestones for minimal features like
    error pages, these minimal features were categorized under this milestone.

 3. Authentication Setup

    >The authentication milestone includes all stories concerning registration, login, and
    authentication. This milestone is critical and important because otherwise, the blog's
    administrators would be unable to manage posts or comments securely without normal users
    having the ability to see and execute administrator commands.

 4. Admin Setup

    >The milestone admin setup includes all stories concerning creating, viewing, updating, and
    deleting posts, in addition to managing comments, users, and categories. This makes it
    simple for administrators to view posts, manage posts, manage comments on these posts,
    and manage administrator users and categories.

 5. User Views

    > The milestone users' views feature allows a blog user to leave a comment on a post,
    filter categories, and bookmark a post. This milestone is critical and essential for
    a user in order to create a comment, filter, and categorize posts.

 6. Documentation

    > This milestone includes all document-related stories and tasks required to
    document the software development process for the application. It aspires to
    provide high-quality documentation that aids in the understanding of all stages of
    development in addition to the information required for running, deploying,
    and operating the application.
