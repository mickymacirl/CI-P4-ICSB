## The Strategy Plane

### Site Goals

The goal of this Irish cyber security blog is to provide readers in Ireland with accurate and up-to-date information about cyber security,
educate the Irish public on how to stay safe online and protect themselves from cyber threats, assist Irish businesses and organizations in improving
their cyber security practices and defending themselves against cyber attacks, act as a resource for Irish cyber security professionals by bringing
them up to date on the latest research and news in the field, and raise awareness of cyber security issues in Ireland to encourage more people to
become interested in this critical topic.

#### Agile Planning

This project was devised using agile practices, with small features delivered in incremental sprints.
There were four sprints in total, that were distributed out at two weeks.

All issues were assigned to epics and prioritized utilizing the labels must, should, could, and nice to have.

They were divided into sprints based on six milestones. "Must have" stories were finished first, followed by "should have" stories, and ultimately "could have" and "nice to have" stories.

This has been done to ensure that all foundational requirements were completed initially, providing the application a complete feel, with must-have features added.

#### Epics

This project has 6 main Epics/Milestones:

1. Basic Setup

2. Stand Alone Pages Setup

3. Authentication Setup
